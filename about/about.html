                Born in San Francisco, California. I have lived in the Bay Area most of my life. 
				I went to high school in Fremont, California and briefly went to high school in Mesa, Arizona.
				I took a 4 year hiatus from school after high school to discover what career path I wanted
				to pursue. In that time I worked as quality assurance at Tesla, a medical device assembler at Olympus Medical,
				and a coating technician at a small specialized silicon chip coating company. Not finding any of this work fulfilling,
				I wanted to go back to school. While taking general education classes at community college, I decided to take an intro to C++ class.
				I loved it, I wanted to pursue Computer Science fully. I have fulfilled all the requirements for transfer and I am enrolled in San Francisco
				State University. Wanting to expedite the hiring process, I have decided to take a 9 month bootcamp at Lambda while I wait for university to start at SFSU.
